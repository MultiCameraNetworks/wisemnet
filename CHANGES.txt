WiSE-MNet 1.2: Changes from WiSE-MNet 1.1
------------------------------------------
- Improved documentation & bug fixes

- Added support for omnetpp 5.0 and opencv 3.2.0

- Added new algorithm MTIC for multi-target tracking

- Added support to download and use multi-camera datasets in directory 'videos'


WiSE-MNet 1.1: Changes from WiSE-MNet 0.1
------------------------------------------

- Included new sensing model to consider directionality of FOVs for cameras.
  The parameters can configured in the *.ini files. Included sample project
  to show its use.

- New PhysicalProcess for reading videofiles in disk (WiSEVideoFile).
  It has no movement, only simulation of a sensing device in a camera.

- Improved the synchronization between analysis and topology discovery. Currently,
  all nodes participate in topology discovery (communication and vision) and no 
  node starts analysis until both discoveries have been completed.

- Included a base class for algorithms to periodic analize content using
  a finite state machine (wiseCameraPeriodicAlgo) similar to the 
  application for target tracking (wiseCameraPeriodicTracker) existing in 
  the previous version.

- Included a buffer to support delayed communication. Implemented within 
  the distributed single target tracker (KCF).

- Included new functions to handle the communication and vision graphs within
  the network. Each node can send data to all neighborgs via a single function.

- Include new tests for different FOV shapes and sources-to-sink scenarios for
  video transmission.

- Implemented a buffer to support delayed communication. Implemented within 
  the distributed single target tracker (KCF).

- Included additional documentation for WiSE related functions. The 
  doxygen-style documentation is include in directory "doc/html"

- Implemented new algorithms for distributed single target tracking 
  based on Kalman and Information Consensus Filters (KCF, ICF)

- Implemented new algorithms for distributed multiple target tracking 
  based on Information Consensus Filters and Nearest Neighborg (ICF-NN)
